        <p> Badminton is a fast-paced and exhilarating racket sport that demands a unique blend of agility, precision, and explosive
        power. Played on a rectangular court divided by a high net, the game involves hitting a shuttlecock—a feathered
        projectile with distinct aerodynamic properties—back and forth. Unlike ball sports, the shuttlecock’s drag causes it to
        decelerate rapidly, forcing players to master a variety of techniques, from delicate net tumbles to thunderous overhead
        smashes. Whether played in singles or doubles, the sport requires intense focus and quick reflexes, as the shuttlecock
        can reach speeds of over 400 km/h in professional matches.
        
        Beyond the physical challenge, badminton is a highly strategic "chess game" played at high speed. Players must
        constantly outmaneuver their opponents by using clever footwork and deceptive shots to create openings in the defense.
        It provides an excellent cardiovascular workout, improving heart health, flexibility, and coordination. Because it is
        relatively easy to learn but difficult to master, badminton has become one of the most popular sports globally, enjoyed
        by millions as both a casual backyard pastime and a prestigious Olympic event.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt> The Serving Rule (Underhand Only)</dt>
            <dd> All serves must be delivered with an underhand stroke, ensuring the shuttlecock is struck below the server's waist.
            Additionally, the serve must travel diagonally across the net and land within the opponent's designated service box to
            be considered legal.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt> The "One Hit" Rule</dt>
            <dd>A player or team is allowed only one contact with the shuttlecock to send it over the net to the opposing side. If you
            hit the shuttlecock twice or if both partners in doubles touch it during the same turn, the rally ends and the point is
            awarded to the opponent. </dd>
            <br>
        <dt>The Net Rule </dt>
        <dd> Players and their rackets are strictly prohibited from touching the net or its supports while the shuttlecock is in
        play. If any part of your body, clothing, or racket makes contact with the net before the rally is officially over, you
        commit a fault and lose the point. </dd>
